This report proves local benchmark reproducibility only. It keeps external provider and human-review gaps visible instead of counting them as complete. The git commit is generation-time context; the evidence bundle SHA is the durable anchor for the artifacts listed below.

## Public Claim Boundary

- ready: `false`
- scope: public benchmark or world-class readiness claim
- policy: Local reproducibility can pass before public claims; public claims require provider evidence, human adjudication, clean release lock, accepted world-class evidence, and complete source checks.

| Blocker |
| --- |
| provider-backed model holdout evidence is incomplete |
| human blind-review adjudication is incomplete |
| world-class evidence is not accepted yet (4 open gaps, 4 ledger pending) |
| world-class source checks are not all accepted (6/13 pass, 7 blocked) |

## Release Lock

- ready: `true`
- reason: clean generation-time HEAD
- status scope: generation-time status before this report is written

## Evidence Bundle

- algorithm: `sha256(path,label,exists,artifact_sha256)`
- artifacts: `25` / `25`
- sha256: `9c52f69857cc545bf9ce703780b1644753f6fdf1ab0b49f702c9dd31e9b46ab9`

## Failure Disclosure

- path: `evals/failure-cases.md`
- disclosed cases: `3`
- policy: Keep representative failures visible and tied to regression checks.

## Limits

- The git commit and dirty flag are generation-time context; the evidence bundle hash is the durable artifact anchor inside a committed report.
- Local command-runner evidence is reproducible but does not replace provider-backed model holdout evidence.
- Pending blind-review decisions are visible but do not count as human adjudication.
- World-class readiness remains false until external and human evidence gaps close.
